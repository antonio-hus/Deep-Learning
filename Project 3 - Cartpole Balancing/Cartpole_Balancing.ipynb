        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks. Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return. In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity. \n",

In this lab, we will focus on *policy gradient* methods which aim to **maximize** the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards. Equivalently, this means that we want to **minimize** the negative likelihood of these same actions. We achieve this by simply **scaling** the probabilities by their associated rewards -- effectively amplifying the likelihood of actions that resujlt in large rewards.\n",

Recall that we can easily compute the negative log-likelihood of a discrete action by evaluting its [softmax cross entropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits). Like in supervised learning, we can use stochastic gradient descent methods to achieve the desired minimization. \n",
